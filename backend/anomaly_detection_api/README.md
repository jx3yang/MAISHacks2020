# Anomaly Detection API

- Get your endpoint and keys by creating your Azure account and signing into your Azure portal [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/#get-started)
- On your portal, go to the `Keys and Endpoint` tab
- Create a `credentials.csv` file with two columns: `key` and `endpoint`. The first line should look like `key,endpoint`
- Copy your `Key` (1 or 2) on Azure, put it on the second row
- Copy your `Endpoint` on Azure, put it on the second row
